- [Software Development as a Team Sport](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) by ThoughtWorks

> Since the early days of our Technology Radar, **we've warned against tools and techniques that isolate members of software teams from one another**, hampering feedback and collaboration. Often, when new specializations come along, practitioners, vendors and tools insist that some part of development must be done in an isolated environment, away from the chaos of "regular" development. We reject that claim and constantly look for new ways to reengage software development as a team sport. Feedback is critical when developing something as complex as software. While projects increasingly require specialization, we strive to fit them into regular collaboration and feedback. We particularly **dislike** the **"10x engineers"** meme and **prefer to focus on creating and enabling "10x teams."** We see this currently playing out in how design, data science and security can be integrated into cross-functional teams and supported with solid automation. The next frontier is bringing more governance and compliance activities into the fold.

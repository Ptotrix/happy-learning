From [https://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html](https://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html):

- These enabling practices of continuous integration, testing, and refactoring, provide a new environment that makes evolutionary design plausible. However one thing we haven't yet figured out is where the balance point is. I'm sure that, despite the outside impression, XP isn't just test, code, and refactor. **There is room for designing before coding**. Some of this is before there is any coding, most of it occurs in the iterations before coding for a particular task. But there is a new balance between up-front design and refactoring.

- Two of the greatest rallying cries in XP are the slogans "Do the Simplest Thing that Could Possibly Work" and "You Aren't Going to Need It" (known as **YAGNI**). Both are manifestations of the XP practice of Simple Design.

From [https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SelfTestingCode.html](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SelfTestingCode.html):

- You have self-testing code when you can run a series of automated tests against the code base and be confident that, should the tests pass, your code is free of any substantial defects.

- Self-testing code is a key part of [Continuous Integration](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html), indeed I say that you aren't really doing continuous integration unless you have self-testing code. As a pillar of Continuous Integration, it is also a necessary part of [Continuous Delivery](https://martinfowler.com/delivery.html).

- One obvious benefit of self-testing code is that it can drastically reduce the number of bugs that get into production software. At the heart of this is building up a testing culture that where developers are naturally thinking about writing code and tests together.
